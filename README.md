# Log Anomaly Detection Framework (with Chainlit + Detectors)

This project is a lightweight yet extensible framework for detecting suspicious activity in system and web server logs. It combines rule-based detection algorithms, custom log parsers, and LLM-based summarization via Chainlit and LangChain.

---

## Features

- **Modular Detectors**: Includes detectors for brute-force SSH attempts, web attack patterns, port scans, user enumeration, DoS attempts, suspicious HTTP methods, and more.
- **LLM Summarization**: Uses OpenAI's GPT-4o via LangChain to summarize threats and allow follow-up natural language queries.
- **Interactive UI**: Built on Chainlit for a simple, chat-style web interface.
- **Standalone Runner**: CLI utility for testing detectors directly and exporting results as `.csv`/`.json`.

## Getting Started

### 1. Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Required packages include:
- `chainlit`
- `openai`
- `langchain`
- `python-dotenv`

---

### 2. Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
```

2. Place sample logs in:
   - `auth_log_files/` for SSH-related logs
   - `access_log_files/` for web server logs

---

## Usage Modes

### Mode 1: Chainlit UI with LLM Summary

Run:

```bash
chainlit run summarise_chainlit.py
```

Upload `.log` files and interact via chat. The LLM will summarize detected anomalies and answer your follow-up questions.

---

### Mode 2: Standalone CLI Runner (No LLM)

Run:

```bash
python run_detectors.py
```

It will:
- Parse log files in `auth_log_files/` and `access_log_files/`
- Run all detectors
- Print findings to terminal
- Export results to `/output/` as `.csv` and `.json`

## Detectors Implemented

| Detector                  | Log Type    | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Brute Force              | `auth.log`  | Detects repeated failed login attempts from same IP                         |
| Intrusion Attempts       | `auth.log`  | Detects rapid SSH login attempts within short time windows                  |
| User Enumeration         | `auth.log`  | Detects scanning for valid usernames via SSH                                |
| Web Attack Detection     | `access.log`| Detects suspicious User-Agents, SQLi, XSS, Path Traversal, sensitive paths  |
| Port Scan Detection      | `access.log`| Detects access to multiple uncommon ports from same IP                      |
| Suspicious HTTP Methods  | `access.log`| Detects rare/unsafe methods (e.g. PUT, DELETE)                              |
| DoS Attempt Detection    | `access.log`| Detects IPs with unusually high request counts                              |

## Outputs

- Printed in terminal for CLI runner
- Summarized in Chainlit UI
- Exported to:
  - `output/brute_force.json`
  - `output/web_attacks.csv`, etc.

---

## Extending This Project

Want to add new detectors?

1. Create a new file in `detectors/`, e.g. `rfi_detector.py`
2. Define a function like: `def detect_remote_file_inclusion(entries): ...`
3. Import and call it in:
   - `summarise_chainlit.py`
   - `run_detectors.py`
4. Format its output as structured data (e.g. list of tuples or dicts)
